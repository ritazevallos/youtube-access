## Youtube Accessibility Awareness

The **Youtube Accessibility Awareness** project was started at the [EvoHax Web Accessibility Hackathon][evohax] on April 17-19, 2015. The goal was to raise awareness of the fact that most Youtube videos are uncaptioned.

Data acquired from the Google Youtube API in real time is displayed as charts using the Chart.js library, showing the percentage of videos that are captioned for those uploaded on a given date. The user can view data for specific dates or break down the amount captioned by specific categories.
